Currently unlicensed, very basic/empty code at this point.

Luawa (Loo-ah-wa) is a web-application 'framework' for Lua. This includes the webserver itself.

The following Lua modules are required (I recommend using Luarocks):
+ Lua (5.1.5 tested), LuaJIT 2 also works
+ lanes
+ luasocket-patch (https://github.com/Fizzadar/luasocket-patch)
